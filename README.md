# Project Overview
This project is designed to showcase advanced SQL querying techniques through the analysis of over 1 million rows of Apple retail sales data. The dataset includes information about products, stores, sales transactions, and warranty claims across various Apple retail locations globally. By tackling a variety of questions, from basic to complex, I have analyzed the data and tried to understand the trends in the sale.
